# Evaluating Expressions

This is a commandline calculator that can take in an expression and return the result.

This can account for parentheses, modulus, adddition, subtraction, modulus, division. This cannot yet take care of decimals, however.

To compile the program, do `gcc evalexpr.c` and use `./a.out "EXPRESSION"` to see some results.

Ex. `./a.out "3 + 5"` or `./a.out "(3 * 5) + 6"`.
